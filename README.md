Database Management Internship â€“ Brainwave
This repository contains projects developed as part of my Database Management Internship at Brainwave. The focus of this internship was on SQL database design, data modeling, and query development for real-world applications.

**ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Library Management System ðŸ“š**
A comprehensive Library Management System designed to efficiently manage book records, user information, borrowing transactions, and fine calculations. This database helps automate library operations and ensures smooth book lending processes.

Borrow & Return Transactions: Track borrowed books and return dates.
Fine Calculation: Automatically calculate overdue fines for late returns.
Search & Filtering: Query books based on title, author, or genre.
ðŸ’» Technologies Used
MySQL for database design and management.
SQL Queries (DDL, DML) to create tables and perform operations.

**ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Online Store Database System ðŸ›’**
An E-commerce Database Management System designed to handle products, customers, orders, and payments. This project focuses on order processing, inventory management, and payment tracking.
